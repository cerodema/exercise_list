<!-- This is the front end website, the first attempt for the break schedule manager 
that I plan to use with my agents in the night shift upon Rosario's approval, it will
be online and agents will use it if they want to take breaks with less frustration and 
more efficiency.

	Work is love, love is work, sacrifice is love.
	Love = work + sacrifice - misery.
	God gave us his love when he worked for 6 days to create us and this world and 
	he finally got to rest at the 7th day. 
	When you are willing to work and sacrifice some of you, when you are willing to 
	make possible something you think it's impossible. There is when the love is 
	valued and then is when we feel loved. So love all the peope before you can find 
	love, before you can get the love that is waiting for you to act, you should start 
	to move and act to get that love. Work is love. But not in the bad way like we have 
	to put work in the relashionship. It's not like it's something bad, you will find 
	pleasure on that kind of work because then is when the relashionship gets defined 
	and tested and then you are assured that what you doing is worth it and is beneficial 
	and that it should ultimately exist and therefore you don't have more insecurities.
